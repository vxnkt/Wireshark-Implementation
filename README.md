# Wireshark-Implementation
Network Security Assignment on an Open Source Tool which aligns with the Coursera course we completed

We chose to make a report on Wireshark because of its importance in understanding how networks function and how vulnerabilities can be detected and analyzed in real time. 
As students interested in cybersecurity and networking, we felt it was important to explore a practical tool that professionals actually use in the field. 

Wireshark stood out because it is open-source, widely adopted, and offers powerful features for monitoring and analyzing network traffic. By studying and reporting on it, we not only learned how to use the tool, but also gained insight into how network attacks can be identified and prevented—skills that are highly valuable in today’s digital world.
